Simple Python implementation of Snake game, including primitive AI.

You can also find a version of this in action at https://repl.it/@jonathanelliott/Group3Snake#main.py

Type `g = Game()` and `g.run()` to see the basic functionality.

Joint work with Justin Roughley and David Budd for Bristol CodeHub Python Dojo.
